# Hull Tactical Market Prediction
A full reproducible pipeline for EDA, feature engineering, model training and backtesting.

This repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow for the Kaggle Hull Tactical Market Prediction competition.
The goal is to build a machine-learning pipeline that predicts short-horizon stock returns and evaluates trading strategies on top of model outputs.

The project includes:

Structured EDA and data quality checks

Systematic feature selection and feature engineering

LightGBM classifier with HalvingRandomSearchCV

Portfolio backtesting with volatility targeting

Modular and reproducible Python package architecture

Optional support for Kaggle inference notebook integration
